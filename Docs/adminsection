## Admin Product Goals

Your admin must do 5 things extremely well:

1. **Triage fast** (what needs attention now?)
2. **Understand risk quickly** (without reading a novel)
3. **Verify completeness** (what’s missing?)
4. **Make a decision** (approve/reject/offer/ask for more info)
5. **Leave an audit trail** (who did what, when, and why)

## The Admin IA (Information Architecture)

### A) Side Navigation (high piriopty other can be added)

* **Dashboard**
* **Applications**
* **Decisions / Offers**
* **Active Loans**
* **Repayments**
* **Hospitals/Providers**
* **Rules & Config**
* **Users**
* **Audit Logs**
* **Settings / Roles**

If you want MVP lean, keep only:
**Dashboard, Applications, Active Loans, Repayments, Rules & Config, Audit Logs**

---

## 1) Dashboard (Admin Home)

### What it should show (CEO-level but actionable)

**KPI Cards**

* New Applications (Today / 7 days)
* Pending Review (requires human action)
* Awaiting Documents
* Approved (not disbursed yet)
* Active Loans
* Overdue Payments (count + ₦ value)

**Queues Preview**

* “Needs Review Now” (top 10)
* “High Risk” (top 10)
* “Stuck for >48h” (top 10)

**Operational Insights**

* Average decision time
* Approval rate
* Common rejection reasons (top 5)

**Why:** The dashboard tells the credit officer where to start *without thinking*.

---

## 2) Applications List (The Workbench)

This is the core admin screen.

### Table Columns (must-have)

* Applicant Name
* Sector: **Government / Private / Self-employed**
* Requested Amount (₦)
* Income (₦) (self-reported for now)
* Estimated Expenses (₦) (self-reported for now)
* **Affordability Score** (internal checker)
* **Risk Badge** (Low / Medium / High) *(internal checker)*
* Stage: Submitted / Incomplete / Under Review / Offer Sent / Approved / Rejected
* Created date
* Owner (which admin is handling)

### Filters (high impact)

* Sector (Gov/Private)
* Risk level
* Stage/status
* Amount range
* Tenor bucket
* Date range
* “Incomplete documents”
* “Over 24/48 hours without action”

### Search

* Name, phone, email, application ID

### Bulk actions (optional but powerful)

* Assign to admin
* Mark as “Need more info”
* Export (CSV)

---

## 3) Application Detail View (Single Case File)

This is where decisions happen. It must be structured like a **doctor’s chart** (ironically): summary first, details second.

### Layout: 3-column structure

**Left: Applicant Snapshot**
**Middle: Verification & Risk**
**Right: Decision Panel**

---

### 3.1 Applicant Snapshot (Left Column)

**Identity Summary**

* Full name
* Phone / email
* Address (basic)
* Employment sector selector: Government / Private
* Employer name
* Job title
* Salary frequency (monthly/weekly)
* Monthly income (₦)
* Monthly expenses (₦)
* Dependents (optional)

**Medical Loan Context**

* Hospital/provider name
* Treatment category (dropdown)
* Severity (Low/Medium/High)
* Treatment estimate (₦)
* Requested amount (₦)
* Reason/notes

**Documents Box**

* ID document (view/download)
* NIN slip (view/download)
* Payslip (if salary)
* Treatment estimate/invoice
* Any extra docs

Each doc has:

* Status: Uploaded / Missing / Needs clearer copy
* Admin note

---

### 3.2 Verification & Risk (Middle Column)

This section contains both:

* **Internal checkers (no APIs)**
* **External checkers (mock placeholders until backend)**

#### A) Internal Checker Cards (No API needed)

These should run instantly on the admin UI.

1. **Sector & Repayment Route**

* Sector: Government / Private
* Repayment priority preview:

  * Gov: Salary deduction → bank debit → card
  * Private: Bank debit → card
    *(This helps admin see what collection path applies.)*

2. **Affordability Checker**
   Compute simple ratios:

* **Loan-to-income ratio** = requested_amount / monthly_income
* **Expense coverage** = monthly_expenses / monthly_income
* **Disposable income** = monthly_income - monthly_expenses
* **Max recommended installment** rule of thumb (editable): e.g. 20–35% of income

Show as:

* Progress bars
* A single summary tag: **Affordable / Tight / Not Affordable**

3. **Risk Badge (Internal)**
   Use internal thresholds (configurable):

* **High Risk** if:

  * expenses >= income (negative disposable)
  * loan-to-income > X (e.g. > 3–5x monthly)
  * requested amount above category cap
  * documents missing
* **Medium Risk** if near thresholds
* **Low Risk** if comfortably within limits

4. **Completeness Score**

* % completion based on required fields + required documents
  Show: 40% / 70% / 100% with missing list

#### B) External Checker Panels (Mock now, real later)

Collapsible sections:

* Dojah KYC: `PENDING / PASSED / FAILED`
* FirstCentral Credit: `PENDING / GOOD / BAD`
* Mono Income: `PENDING / CONSISTENT / INCONSISTENT`
* Remita Payroll: `PENDING / VERIFIED / NOT VERIFIED`

For now, populate with:

* “Not connected yet” or “Mocked value”
* A “simulate result” dropdown (admin testing tool)

**Key:** you can *simulate* integration outcomes now to validate UX and decision workflow.

---

### 3.3 Decision Panel (Right Column)

This is the “controls” area. It should be sticky (always visible).

**Recommendation Header**

* System recommendation: Approve / Review / Reject *(based on internal checkers for now)*
* Confidence: Low/Med/High
* Top 3 reasons (auto-generated)

**Actions**

* ✅ Approve
* ❌ Reject
* 📝 Request More Info
* ✍️ Modify Offer (counter-offer)

**Offer Builder**

* Approved amount (editable)
* Tenor bucket selector (1–2, 2–3, 6–7 months)
* Interest/fee (from config)
* Downpayment (optional)
* Repayment schedule preview
* Hospital payout details

**Decision Notes**

* Required textarea: reason
* Add internal tags:

  * “High income but high expenses”
  * “Missing payslip”
  * “Treatment estimate too high”
  * “Employer unclear”
* Timestamp auto captured
* Admin name auto captured

---

## 4) Risk Categories & Loan Categories (the thing you mentioned)

You asked for “theft categories” and “loan categories.” I’m going to interpret that safely as:

* **Risk categories** (fraud/affordability)
* **Loan categories** (medical type + amount limits)

### A) Loan Categories (Medical)

Create admin-manageable categories:

* Outpatient minor care
* Diagnostics & tests
* Surgery
* Maternity
* Emergency
* Chronic management
* Pharmacy/medication

Each category has:

* Max loan amount cap
* Default tenor suggestion
* Required documents list
* Risk weighting (optional)

### B) Risk Categories (Internal)

Create “flags” that can appear automatically:

* Affordability risk
* Documentation risk
* Employment clarity risk
* Provider mismatch risk (estimate vs request)
* Duplicate application risk (same phone/BVN later)
* High amount request risk

These flags should drive:

* Risk badge color
* Queue sorting (high-risk rises to top)
* Decision recommendation

---

## 5) Rules & Config (Super Admin)

This is where you keep your system flexible (you asked for editable interest etc.)

**Editable Rules**

* Interest/fees per tenor
* Max loan-to-income ratio
* Max expense ratio
* Max amount per category
* Required documents per sector
* Risk badge thresholds
* Default repayment method priority

This is what prevents engineers from hardcoding business logic.

---

## 6) Repayments & Loans Admin (MVP)

Even if collections is “soft reminders,” you still need clean visibility.

**Active Loans list**

* borrower, amount, disbursed date, next due date, status

**Repayment schedule**

* installment rows, paid/unpaid, attempts log

**Reminder log**

* when reminders were sent, by what channel

---

## 7) Mocking Strategy (so devs can build now)

To build admin robustly before backend integrations:

### Mock objects you should standardize

* `application`
* `documents`
* `riskSummary`
* `verificationSummary` (dojah/mono/remita/firstcentral)
* `decisionHistory`

### “Simulation controls” (dev-only toggle)

* A dropdown to set:

  * Dojah: pass/fail/pending
  * FirstCentral: good/bad/pending
  * Mono: consistent/inconsistent/pending
  * Remita: verified/not/pending
    This will help your team test every scenario fast.

---

## 8) The Admin UI style (your elegance requirement)

Make admin feel “premium + clear”:

* Card layout, soft shadows
* Left navigation with icons
* Consistent badges:

  * Green = good/verified
  * Amber = review/pending
  * Red = high risk/fail
* A lot of whitespace
* A strong typography scale

This is where shadcn/ui + Tailwind + TanStack Table shines (if you’re on React).
